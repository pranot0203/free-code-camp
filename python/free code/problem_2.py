Step 1
Strings are sequences of characters used to store text data. As you might recall from previous lessons, you can create a string by enclosing text inside either single (') or double (") quotes. For example:

greeting = 'Hello'
print(greeting) # Output: Hello
Create a variable first_name which stores the string John and a variable last_name which stores the string Doe. Then print first_name and last_name.

Step 2
In Python, you can combine strings using the + operator. This is called concatenation. Here is an example:

greeting = 'Hello' + 'World'
print(greeting) # Output: HelloWorld
Create a variable full_name by concatenating first_name and last_name. Then print full_name.

Step 3
If you concatenate two strings like 'John' + 'Doe', the result is 'JohnDoe' with no space. To fix this, you need to concatenate a string containing a space (' ') between them.

Update your full_name variable so it concatenates first_name, a space, and last_name.

Step 4
Next, create a variable address to store the employee's address. Assign it the string 123 Main Street, and finally print address.

Step 5
Now, your address seems incomplete. You also want to add the apartment number where the employee lives, so you should modify the variable.

When you want to add content to the end of an existing string variable, you can use the augmented assignment operator ,+=. This is shorter than writing var = var + 'new text'. For example:

greeting = 'Hello'
greeting += ' World'
print(greeting) # Hello World
Remember that strings are immutable, therefore this operation does not change the original string. Instead it creates a new string and reassigns it to the variable.

Use the += operator to add the string , Apartment 4B to your address variable.

Step 6
The output in the terminal is getting crowded. Before you continue, it's time to clean it up.

Remove all the print() statements from your code.

Step 7
Now create a variable named employee_age and assign it the integer 28.

Step 8
Now, you want to create a string that displays the employee's age.

Start by creating a variable employee_info and assign it the result of concatenating:

the full_name variable.
a string consisting of the characters is preceded and followed by a space.

Step 9
Update the employee_info assignment to also concatenate employee_age at the end.

Once you've done so, you'll see a TypeError in the terminal. In the next step, you'll work on fixing it.

Step 10
As you can see Python raised a TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. This happens because Python does not allow you to concatenate text (strings) and numbers (integers) directly.

To fix this, you must convert the number to a string first using the str() function, which returns the string version of an object:

my_num = str(42)
print(type(my_num)) # <class 'str'>
Update your employee_info assignment to convert employee_age to a string using str(employee_age).

Step 11
Now complete the sentence by updating the employee_info assignment to also concatenate the string  years old at the end. Remember to include a space at the beginning of your string.

Finally, print employee_info.

Step 12
Now you're going to use the str() function one more time. Just like with age, you must convert any numeric variable to a string before concatenating it with other text.

Create a variable named experience_years and assign it the integer 5.

Then, create a variable experience_info. Assign it a string formed by concatenating 'Experience: ', the experience_years variable (converted to a string), and ' years'. Print the result to the terminal.

Step 13
Concatenating many strings using + and converting numbers using str() can get messy and hard to read.

Python 3.6 introduced f-strings to solve this. By adding the letter f before the opening quote, you can put variables and expressions inside replacement fields represented by curly braces {}. For example:

name = 'John'
print(f'Hello {name}') # Output: Hello John
Create a variable employee_card and assign it an f-string that displays Employee: followed by a space and the value of the full_name variable.

Step 14
Currently, employee_card only shows the employee's name. Now you're going to add more information to it.

Update the employee_card assignment to include the employee's age. The final string should look like this: Employee: [name] | Age: [age] with [name] replaced with the employee's name, and [age] replaced with the employee's age.

Step 15
Now it's time to add the final details to the card.

Create a variable named position with the value of the string Data Analyst and a variable named salary with the value of the integer 75000.

Then, update your employee_card f-string to include the position and salary. It should follow this exact format: Employee: [full_name] | Age: [employee_age] | Position: [position] | Salary: $[salary]. Replace the placeholders with the corresponding variables.

Finally, print employee_card to see the result.

Step 16
When working with strings, you'll often need to extract a specific portion of a string. This is called slicing.

The syntax is string[start:stop], where:

start is the index where the slice begins (inclusive).
stop is the index where the slice ends (exclusive).
For example, if text = 'Python', then text[0:2] gives 'Py'.

Define employee_code as 'DEV-2026-JD-001'. After that, create a variable department and assign it the slice of employee_code from index 0 to 3. Then print department to the terminal.

Step 17
You can slice from any part of the string, not just the beginning. And it is helpful in many cases.

Create a variable year_code and assign it the slice of employee_code from index 4 to 8. This will extract 2026.

Then create a variable initials and assign it the slice of employee_code from index 9 to 11. This will extract JD.

Finally, print both variables to the terminal.

Step 18
You can also use negative numbers to slice from the end of a string. For example, -1 refers to the last character, -2 refers to the second-to-last character, and so on.

To get the last three characters of a string, you can use string[-3:]. Note how the stop parameter is omitted after the colon. This means the slicing should proceed up to the string boundary.

Create a variable named last_three. Use negative indexing to extract the last three characters from employee_code (which represent the ID number). Finally, print last_three to the terminal.

With that, the employee card workshop is complete.
