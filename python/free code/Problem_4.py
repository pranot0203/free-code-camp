'''Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice how to use booleans and conditional statements in Python by building a movie ticket booking calculator.#
Begin by declaring variables that store information about the user and the movie show.
As you learned in previous lessons, variables are assigned using the assignment operator (=) this way:
Assigns the value 10 to variable x
x = 10
Create a variable named base_price to store the base price of the movie ticket and set its value to 15. Create another variable named age to store the user's age and set its value to 21.


Step 2
Now you need to store some string values about the movie ticket. You can store strings in Python this way:

Example Code
name = 'Alice'
Create a variable named seat_type to store the type of seat the user has selected and set its value to the string Gold. Create another variable named show_time to store the show time of the movie and set its value to the string Evening.

Remember to surround both values with either single or double quotes.

Step 3
As you learned in previous lessons, in Python, an if statement can be used to run code depending on if a condition is true.

An if statement consists of the if keyword, followed by a condition and a colon. The code to run when the condition is true, which must be indented, is called the body of the if statement.

Example Code
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
In this step, you will check if the user is eligible to book a movie ticket based on their age.

Create an if statement to check if age is greater than 17. Inside the body of the if statement, print User is eligible to book a ticket. This will print the message only when the user's age is greater than 17.

Remember to indent the body of the if statement and surround the message with single or double quotes inside the print() call.


Step 4
Now you will check whether the user is allowed to book an evening show based on their age.

Create an if statement to check if age is greater than or equal to 21. Inside the body of the if statement, print User is eligible for Evening shows.

Step 5
In the previous step, you checked a condition using an if statement. The else clause is used to handle the case when the condition is false. Here's the syntax of an if...else statement:

Example Code
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
Now, add an else clause to your if statement and print User is not eligible for Evening shows inside the else body. This will print only when the condition in the if statement is false.

Step 6
Some information can only be true or false. As you have learned in previous lessons, this can be represented using boolean values.

Create a variable named is_member to indicate whether the user is a member and set its value to True.

Below the is_member variable create another variable named is_weekend to indicate whether the movie show is on a weekend and sets its value to False. Do not surround the value with quotes.

Step 7
The user qualifies for a membership discount if they are a member.

Create a variable named discount and set its value to 0. This will store the discount the user gets on the movie ticket

Step 8
In Python, if conditions don't have to compare values explicitly to True or False. Instead, they rely on the truthiness of values. Truthy values evaluate to True in a boolean context, such as the condition of an if statement. These include non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and the boolean value True.

Example Code
if value:
   print('value is truthy')
Create an if statement to check if is_member is truthy. Inside the body of the if statement, update the discount value to 3 and print User qualifies for membership discount to the terminal.

Step 9
You should also handle the case when the user does not qualify for a membership discount.

Add an else clause to your if statement and print User does not qualify for membership discount inside the else body.

You can print a message followed by a variable like this:

Example Code
print('Total:', total)
You also want to display the updated value of discount. Below the if...else statement, use the print() call to display a message that shows Discount: followed by the updated value of discount. Then, check the output in the terminal.


Step 10
In Python, the and operator is used to check if multiple conditions are true. Here's how you can use it to combine two conditions in an if statement:

Example Code
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are True
The membership discount should only apply to members if their age is greater than or equal to 21.

Update the condition of the if is_member: line by using the and operator to combine the existing condition with another condition checking if age is greater than or equal to 21.


Step 11
Now change the value of the is_member variable to False as the user is not a member.

After that, you will see that the discount value now remains 0, because both conditions must be satisfied for the discount to apply.

Step 12
Now create a variable named extra_charges and set it to 0. This will represent extra charges to apply to the movie ticket on weekends.

Then, create an if statement to check if is_weekend is truthy. Inside the body of if statement, update the extra_charges value to 2 and print Extra charges will be applied in the terminal.

Step 13
Now, add an else clause to your if statement and print No extra charges will be applied inside the else body. This will print the message only when the extra charges condition is false.

Then, below the else clause, use the print() call to display a message that shows Extra charges: followed by the updated value of extra_charges and check the output in the terminal.
 
Step 14
In Python, the or operator is used to check whether at least one of two conditions is true. Here's how you can use it in an if statement:

Example Code
if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code to execute if any condition is True
Extra charges should also apply if the show is in the evening. Update the condition of the if is_weekend: line by using the or operator to combine the existing condition with a second condition checking if show_time is equal to the string Evening. 

Step 15
Now you will check if the user satisfies the conditions to book a movie ticket. Users with age 21 or above can always book tickets without any restrictions.

Create an if statement to check if age is greater than or equal to 21. Inside the body of the if statement, print Ticket booking condition satisfied to the terminal.

Then, add an else clause to your if statement and print Ticket booking failed due to restrictions inside the else body.

Step 16
Users between 18 and 21 can book tickets, but only when the show_time is not Evening.

Update the condition of the if age >= 21: line. Use the and operator to build an expression checking if age is greater than or equal to 18 and show_time is not Evening. Then use the or operator to combine that expression with the existing condition. Do not create new variables.

Step 17
There is one more exception to the booking rules. Users between 18 and 21 can book evening shows if they are members.

When multiple logical operators are used in an if statement, conditions joined with and are evaluated before conditions joined with or. Parentheses () are used in Python to group conditions and control the order in which they are evaluated.

Example Code
if condition1 and (condition2 or condition3):
    # Code to execute if conditions evaluate to True
else:
    # Code to execute if conditions evaluate to False
Update the condition of the if age >= 21 or age >= 18 and show_time != 'Evening': line to add another condition using the or operator to check if is_member is truthy. Use parentheses () to group the show_time != 'Evening' and is_member conditions together as shown in the above example.

Step 18
In Python, an if statement can also be placed inside the body of another if statement. This is called a nested if statement.

A nested if statement allows you to check an additional condition only after the first condition has already been satisfied. The inner if statement will run only if the outer if condition is true.

Example Code
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
    if condition2:
        # Code to execute if both conditions are True
Now you will calculate service charges based on the type of seat the user has selected.

Inside the body of the last if statement, below the print('Ticket booking condition satisfied') line, create a variable named service_charges and set it to 0. Make sure to indent your code by four spaces to keep it inside the outer if statement body.

Then, create a nested if statement to check if seat_type is equal to Premium. Inside the body of the nested if statement, update the service_charges value to 5.

Step 19
Still inside the body of the outer if statement, add an else clause to the nested if seat_type == 'Premium': statement and update the service_charges value to 1 inside the else body. Make sure to keep the else indented by four spaces to stay inside the outer if statement body.

Step 20
The if...elif...else statement is used to check multiple conditions in order.

Example Code
if condition1:
   # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
   # Code to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
   # Code to execute if all conditions are False
Still inside the body of the outer if statement, add an elif clause between the if seat_type == 'Premium': and else: lines and check if seat_type is equal to Gold. Inside the body of the elif clause, update the value of service_charges to 3.

Below the nested if...elif...else statement, use the print() call to display a message that shows Service charges: followed by the updated value of service_charges. Then, check the output in the terminal.

Step 21
In this final step, you will calculate the final price of the movie ticket using the values calculated in the previous steps.

The final ticket price is calculated by adding the extra charges and service charges to the base price, and then subtracting the discount.

Inside the body of the last if statement, below the print('Service charges:', service_charges) line, calculate the final price of the ticket and store it in a variable named final_price.

Finally, print a message that shows Final price of ticket: followed by the value of final_price.

    service_charges = 0
    if seat_type == 'Premium':
        service_charges = 5

    print('Service charges:', service_charges)
    final_price = base_price - discount + extra_charges + service_charges
    print('Final price of ticket:', final_price)
    
else:
    print('Ticket booking failed due to restrictions')
